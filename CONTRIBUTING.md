# Contributing Guide For bazel-maven-deps

This page lists the operational governance model of this project, as well as the recommendations and requirements for how to best contribute to bazel-maven-deps. We strive to obey these as best as possible. As always, thanks for contributing – we hope these guidelines make it easier and shed some light on our approach and processes.

# Governance Model

## Published but not supported

The intent and goal of open sourcing this project is because it may contain useful or interesting code/concepts that we wish to share with the larger open source community. Although occasional work may be done on it, we will not be looking for or soliciting contributions.

# Getting started

Clone the repo.

## Setup Eclipse

Import into Eclipse using *File > Import... > Maven > Existing Maven Projects*.

Setup launch configurations as need for the [DependenciesToolCli](tool/src/main/java/com/salesforce/tools/bazel/mavendependencies/tool/cli/DependenciesToolCli.java).

## Build & Run from Command Line

Ensure you have Bazelisk installed (`brew install bazelisk`).

Then you can build & run the graph tool:

```shell
bazel run :cli -- --help
```

# Creating a Pull Request

1. **Ensure the bug/feature was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues.  If none exists, create a new issue so that other contributors can keep track of what you are trying to add/fix and offer suggestions (or let you know if there is already an effort in progress).
3. **Clone** the forked repo to your machine.
4. **Create** a new branch to contain your work (e.g. `git br fix-issue-11`)
4. **Commit** changes to your own branch.
5. **Push** your work back up to your fork. (e.g. `git push fix-issue-11`)
6. **Submit** a Pull Request against the `main` branch and refer to the issue(s) you are fixing. Try not to pollute your pull request with unintended changes. Keep it simple and small.
7. **Sign** the Salesforce CLA (you will be prompted to do so when submitting the Pull Request)

> **NOTE**: Be sure to [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) before making a pull request.
